#What The Truck!
![](img/i1-demo.png)
##Purpose
To create a simple single-page application that displays intuitive, real-time information from local food truck venues.

##Features
1. Live, relevant venue information
1. Minimal and easy-to-read UI
1. Fair and relative rating system derived from Foursquare's 1-10 system

##Technologies
1. Bootstrap
1. Functional JavaScript
1. jQuery
1. JSON/AJAX
1. Foursquare API

##Constraints
1. Range & Quality of API data
1. Client-side latency

##Procedure for project
1. ~~Digest Foursquare API~~
1. ~~Define keys from API~~
1. ~~Optimize UI to continually compliment live API data~~
1. ~~Test data against request~~
1. ~~Create responsive bootstrap layout.~~
1. ~~Refactor JS~~
1. Beautify; make 100% responsive
1. Refactor with Angluar

##Stretch Goals/Future Iterations
1. Refactor with NodeJS and remove client-side scripting to optimize performance
1. Make platform API agnostic so I can:
1. Cross-reference data between APIs and return the most relevant data from a given source; i.e., Yelp, Google Places, etc
1. Geolocation. Not really a stretch
1. Optimize for touch-screen devices
1. g[11] rating system
